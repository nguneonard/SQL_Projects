## Project Description:
This project explores data from BusinessFinancing.co.uk to discover the oldest businesses in the world, when were they founded, and which industries they belong to. The project uses SQL to join, manipulate, and analyze data from multiple datasets to answer questions about the world's oldest businesses.

## Project Tasks:
- The oldest business in the world: Find the oldest business in the world and the year it was founded.
- How many businesses were founded before 1000? Count the number of businesses that were founded before the year 1000.
- Which businesses were founded before 1000? List the names and founding years of the businesses that were founded before the year 1000.
- Exploring the categories: List the unique categories of businesses in the dataset.
- Counting the categories: Count the number of businesses in each category.
- Oldest business by continent: Find the oldest business on each continent and the year it was founded.
- Joining everything for further analysis: Join the business and continent datasets to allow for further analysis.
- Counting categories by continent: Count the number of businesses in each category on each continent.
- Filtering counts by continent and category: Filter the counts from task 8 to show only the counts for a specific continent and category.

## Getting Started:
To get started, clone this repository and ensure that you have access to a SQL database. You will need to import the provided datasets into your database and update the connection information in the code to connect to your database. The project uses SQL, so you will need a basic understanding of SQL to complete the tasks.

## Dataset:
The project uses two datasets provided by BusinessFinancing.co.uk:

- businesses.csv: contains the business, year_founded, category_code and country_code.
- countries.csv: contains the country_code, country and continent.
- categories.csv: contains the category_code	and category

## Conclusion:
By completing this project, you will have gained experience with SQL joining, manipulation, and analysis techniques. You will also have a better understanding of the world's oldest businesses and the industries in which they operate.
